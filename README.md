Project Title: DevOps Toolchain Integration for COMP Courses

The purpose of this project is to enhance our understanding of DevOps principles and practices, enabling them to effectively manage code, collaborate in teams, and automate software delivery pipelines. By providing a practical environment for learning and experimentation, our project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application in the field of software development and operations.

Once the project is set up, students can begin using the DevOps toolchain to manage their course projects effectively. They will learn how to create and manage Git repositories on GitHub, set up Docker containers for their applications, configure Jenkins pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, and utilize Azure DevOps boards for agile project management. Examples and sample workflows will be provided to demonstrate how each tool integrates into the development lifecycle, from code versioning and collaboration to automated testing and deployment.
